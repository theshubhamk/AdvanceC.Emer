//more optimization
------------>
SRC:= $(wildcard *.c) // gets all the .c file in SRC.
OBJ:= $(patsubst *.c, *.o, $(SRC)) // replace * by % will show all the compilation steps while compiling // creates .o and .c file from SRC .c files

out.exe: $(OBJ)
	gcc -o $@ $^ // $@ replaces itself by out.exe and $^ replaces itself by $(OBJ)
	
clean: //built in target // has no dependencies
	rm *.o *.exe

run:
	make && ./calc.exe // this will compile and also run the .exe file after compilaton

//make -f <makefile name> // this is used to run a non standard makefile
e.g : make -f mymakefile
